I get annoyed by seemingly harmless things. So, since it has been a while since I have written any blog posts, I have decided to make a list of some things I dislike. Perhaps some of you readers have these same pet peeves.

1. People who eat breakfast foods (i.e. cereal) for any other meal besides breakfast
2. People who don't pick up after their dog
3. 99% of all children
4. People who say "just be yourself" unironically
5. People who cannot integrate cos<sup>4</sup>(x) in their head
6. Having to pay taxes to avoid getting arrested and put in jail
7. Narcissists, histrionics, tourists, and shills
