To any potential readers,

This is first of possibly many blog posts on this site. To start things off, I am Sean C Wang, a college student studying at [UCLA](http://www.ucla.edu). I have created this blog as a way to kill time during my Winter Break, but it may evolve into something more than that. My blog will mainly be about my daily experiences and thoughts, nothing too technical though, as that really isn't what I'm good at. As a warning, the layout of this site may change sporadically since I want to mess around with the various features available. Images and pictures, if any, will be a rare occurrence, since, among various other reasons, I believe that every time a picture of me is taken, a piece of my soul disappears. Well, that's about it for now, I hope my writings bring pleasure to you all. Feel free to email any feedback you may have to *seanwang22(at)ucla.edu* and I will try my best to respond in a timely manner.
