After only a couple posts last winter, I discovered that I am too incompetent to blog properly. Perhaps one day I'll learn to write correctly, but for now, I am focusing on other things such as a summer job and an unending journey of self-discovery. Added to that, I'm sure no one was genuinely interested in what I had to say anyway.

On the bright side, my [current summer job][1] is the best I've ever had. It provides me with enough money to buy many things I've always wanted but never could afford. This means I can easily buy all of the things that are on my [wishlist][2], I just still have that poor-guy mentality and am not used to spending large amounts of money... yet. Also, even though my current lifestyle is by no means considered wealthy (first-world standards), the end dream of video games and all-you-can-eat buffets every weekend is slowly becoming more realizable.

To end, if you are a particular someone who I think is reading this:

Hope you can understand.
