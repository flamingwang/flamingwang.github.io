There seems to be a direct relation between years I've been alive and number of things that annoy me. So much so that it's time for another list of things I dislike.

1. Quarter-squats, quarter-pull-ups, quarter-push-ups, quarter anything in general
2. Crying children on airplanes
3. Bottled water which costs more than $1.25
4. [Spanish clouds][1]
5. People who post their political opinions on Facebook
6. Individuals who have a net output to society which is negative
7. Wetzels Pretzels
8. Stupid people who think my waifu is shit when in reality it is their waifu that is shit
