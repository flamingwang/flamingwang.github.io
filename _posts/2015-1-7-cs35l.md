Every time I have to take a computer class, I feel it must be blatantly obvious to all the people around me that I am not actually a computer science major (well maybe not THAT obvious... I still remain Asian). I imagine for other people it's probably a huge ego boost to sit next to the guy that needs to look at his fingers all the time when he's typing. With that said, this quarter I am enrolled in a class called "Software Construction Laboratory," and so far the goal has been learning how to read ambiguous specifications. It is either that, or Telepathy 101 was supposed to be a pre-requisite class but the school registrar forgot and let me enroll anyway. Only one week into school but already I feel myself becoming one with the ambiguity. Reminds me of drinking [Dr Pepper][1] and solving trig problems involving [one angle and two sides][2].
