After yet another long hiatus I am back again.  During my absence a lot has happened in the USA.  I often struggle to find suitable words to accurately express my inner thoughts, yet still feel compelled to convey something meaningful instead of regurgitating ideas others already fleshed out more eloquently.  The end result is a lack of blog posts and a very unpopular blog.  Furthermore, the truth is I am often just too unmotivated to write. 

During my time away from blogging I have tried several dating apps and feel like sharing my experiences.  The apps allow a glimpse into the parallel yet disparate realities inhabited by heterosexual men and women (as I lack the experience to write intelligently on LGBTQ+ dating), and has been very educational.  Below I will describe some general tips and guidelines and in my next post I will describe the apps I used and my experience in each one.

**General Tips and Guidelines for Dating**: 

1. Bad grammar is unpleasant and unattractive, be sure you are getting your verb tenses and punctuation down correctly. 

2. Having high standards can come off as bitchy (if you are a girl) or 
douche-ey (if you are a guy).  Do not let people shame you for having high 
standards.  From an evolutionary perspective being selective is vital 
to the survival of offspring.....  (^; 

3. Avoid \"bad idea pictures\" because they are magnets for creepy comments: \"In a ball pit\", \"Riding a horse\", \"Mouth open with food inside\", 
\"Swimming\"... The list expands with each passing day as creepy comments 
evolve to adapt - like an evolutionary game of cat-and-mouse.

4. Avoid creating a profile that is just a collection of cliches.  Examples 
include: \"new to the area\", \"can make me laugh\", \"foodie\", or \"no hookups\". Keep in mind that laughing gas makes people laugh too. 

5. Realize you will inevitably have to live with a guilty conscience for any 
deception used to obtain sexual intercourse.   This includes exaggerating 
to a partner more commitment than intended or optical illusion photography 
to disguise body weight.  Avoidance of this guilty conscience, assuming you have a conscience, incentivizes acting with honesty and integrity 

6. Realize you will eventually become too old and close to death to afford the 
time investment of dating.  With this understanding, avoid judgement based 
on superficial traits such as height, salary, or nose shape. 

7. While it is tempting to shrug off racial romantic preferences as natural or 
accidental, they are in fact guided by a larger racial hierarchy and are 
political in nature.

As a final disclaimer, it is your dating life and not that of anyone else.  Greatness is not from blind obedience (much less blind obedience to some random dude\'s blog post), but from copying only that which is good.  I hope to see you all in the next blog post. 

Side Note:  I am sorry for the harm caused by any of my previous posts.  I 
feel I should leave the posts untouched because editing them would be 
enacting revisionist history.  Through self-examination I hope to learn 
from my mistakes and in doing so strive to become a more knowledgeable and 
compassionate individual.
