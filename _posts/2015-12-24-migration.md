After typing a bunch of stuff I do not understand into a terminal (i.e. a typical day with Linux), my blog has been migrated from [Divshot][1] over to [Github Pages][3]. This is because Divshot is becoming a part of [Firebase][2], and I do not understand data enough to properly utilize the Firebase development platform. Moreover, I have to pay them $5 a month if I want to have a custom domain, but Github Pages lets me do this for free.

What all this means is you can read my blog at [flamingwang.github.io][4], or you can read it at [seanwang.org][5], they are aliases of each other. 

I personally prefer [seanwang.org][5], since this makes me seem like a legit organization.
