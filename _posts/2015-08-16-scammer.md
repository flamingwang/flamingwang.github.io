I've been learning lots from my summer internship, and have discovered an extremely efficient but incredibly EVIL way of getting a nutritious filling meal for low cost. I have named this strategy **Soup Scamming** and it involves going to the soup counter, draining out the watery portions of a soup, and then only scooping the solid portions. This means you squeeze a full meal out of the soup of the day, but the poor schmuck who wants soup after you is only left with watery stuff. Below is a list of soups and their resulting outcomes after scamming.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Out of compassion for your fellow human beans you should NEVER do this...

*[NEVER]: But you will anyway

| Chicken Noodle &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   | Chicken Pasta      | Chicken Water  |
| Minestrone         | Pasta in Red Sauce &nbsp;&nbsp; | Tomato Water   |
| Pozole             | Maize and Meat     | Spicy Water   |
| Chili              | Extra Meaty Chili  | Watery Chili   |
| Clam Chowder       | Clam and Potatoes  | Clam-Flavored Cream |
