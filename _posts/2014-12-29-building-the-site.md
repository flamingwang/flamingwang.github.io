I feel almost forced to create more posts so that my blog appear less "chode-ey" to any readers out there. That being said, this post is devoted to discussing the various site features, as well as justifications behind them. For starters, I made this site using the very user-friendly static site generator [Jekyll][1] and the current layout is just the base Jekyll theme with a few personalizing touches here and there. Inspiration for these special touches came from the Android holo-dark theme, which I really enjoy, as well as my school studies in electrical engineering. Any glow effects you may notice were done with care using Microsoft paint, so don't expect anything too professional out of them.  On the footer of this site there are three available links for clicking: a [GitHub][2] link that does not have much activity, a [Facebook][3] link that also does not have much activity, and (most importantly) an Amazon [wish list][4] for the extremely wealthy who want to get me something nice. Finally, as note for the academically-inclined out there: the dot convention is justified since there is a mutually coupled inductor hidden elsewhere in the site. My engineering instincts would never allow me to abuse circuit symbols, not even just for artistic purposes. That's about all I have to say for now, hopefully my post count increases so the wide appearance of the site is alleviated. More posts to come, all in due time...
