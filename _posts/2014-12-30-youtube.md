I spend a majority of my free time watching videos on YouTube and even when I am working on other stuff, I like leaving videos on in the background as a form of ambient noise. One of my favorite channels is [Trump][1] a professional video game player who has daily streams and videos of him playing [Hearthstone][2], a card game by Blizzard. Even though I have never played a game of Hearthstone in my life, there is just something about special about the game and the person playing it that makes it fun to watch. Often times, when I am working on papers or problem sets, I leave his channel on just to stay on task and productive. Perhaps Trump also reminds me of myself as I am extremely introverted and go to great lengths to avoid excessive interaction with others. Another channel I enjoy is [VICE][3] but the quality of their content has high variance and is heavily dependent on which member of their staff is reporting. Various other enjoyable channels include [TheGodfatherDictator][4], which I feel is one of the most underrated gaming channels out there, and FullPredatorEpisodes[^1], which contains archived episodes of the unintentionally hilarious show *To Catch a Predator*.
