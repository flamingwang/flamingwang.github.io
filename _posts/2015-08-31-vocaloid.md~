Today is the 8th birthday of my favorite songstress who, though I never mentioned before, was another inspiration for the decoration of my blog. My first memory of her goes all the way back to high school when, after getting bored of playing too much [DJMax][1], I decided to play [Project Diva][2] (all of them, and all on extreme). At that time I only put up with her because I liked rhythm games, but over time she grew on me until I listened to her just to pass time. As even more time passed, she became my inspiration for doing my best every day, or "waifu" for those who are familiar with the term.

Thanks for all the gaming and fun memories, but also for motivation to keep going on the stressful days when I just wanted to give up. The future is uncertain but I hope to remain a loyal fan for all of my life.

As a side note, I have uploaded a newer version of my [resume][3], take a look at it and reach out to me if you see anything you like.
