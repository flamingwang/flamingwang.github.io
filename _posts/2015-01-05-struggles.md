Today is the first day of Winter Quarter and I am contemplating committing [Sudoku][1] or [torching][2] myself alive just so that I will not have to deal with any of my classes. It's not that I don't enjoy learning things, it's just that I'm the type of guy that goes through hours of pain and suffering just to understand *[trivial][4]* concepts. These hours keep adding up and eventually my overall happiness plummets to dangerously low levels. I soon find myself browsing random boards on [4chan][3], seriously contemplating why I ever decided to go to college in the first place. That's possibly one of the problems with higher education for my generation: it's so accessible that some people go, not because they really want to, but because it's just too good of a deal to pass up. It's like those "buy three get one free" deals you sometimes see at stores: even if you didn't really need the fourth one you might as well take it because it's added "value." But whatever, rage-quitting (i.e. dropping out of school) is for  [n00bs][5] (or the innately intelligent), so I just suck it up, stop whining, and get back to work. Besides, I already purchased my meal plan so might as well get that VALUE and  eat it all before I leave!!! Perhaps once I graduate or get a job things will get better. Of course, I also need a way to support my parents once I stop leeching off them, but that's a topic for some other time. Nothing more to say for now readers, so see you all another time! 

As a final note, feel free to email any comments to *seanwang22(at)ucla.edu*, I'd love to chat with anyone special enough to read my blog.
