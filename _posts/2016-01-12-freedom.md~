One of my goals in life is to obtain lots of money, such that I become part of the 1%. This is not because I want to be a rich oppressive shitlord, but because money is true freedom, and I want to be free person. For example, the average wage worker does not truly have freedom of speech, since if he speaks his mind he can get fired. If he is fired and cannot find another source of income, he may soon not have enough money to afford basic food and shelter. Therefore, his lack of money restrains him from voicing any of his controversial opinions. Compare this to [Donald Trump][1], who is able to voice all sorts of opinions without any fear of not having a place to live or food to eat. The goal therefore is to become like Donald Trump, not in political belief, but in wealth and power. When this happens I can finally release all my opinions, which, like vegetables, are unpopular but good for people.

AFAIK, there are only two ways to achieve this goal: be lucky or work hard. Since I can only control the latter way, I should work harder than everyone around me. This is easy since currently the only people around me are college students â˜º. 
Explaining the previous sentence would be opening a giant can of offense, something I do not yet have the power to do without reprecussion.
