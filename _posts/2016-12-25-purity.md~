A peculiar quirk I picked up this year is a strange, almost obsessive fascination with the pursuit of purity. I say PURSUIT intentionally, since ACTUAL purity is an impossibly difficult and meaningless endeavor. For example, all molecules, unless composed of only a single element, can be thought of as atomically impure. Moreover, isotopes mean that even collections of the same element may also be impure. 


This is at odds with the rest of the world, which seems to be against this purity for some reason. 
After an almost year-long hiatus, I have returned to blogging, primarily to wrap up the [list of resolutions][1] I made at the start of the year. Most importantly, **Resolution #1: Write at least one blog post per month** remains unfulfilled. This means I have rougly 6 days to write 10 blog posts, or face the shame of becoming a loser that was unable to complete his New Years resolutions. The exception to this is the sub 5:00 resolution, since, as year 2016 progressed, I realized that I would rather run a couple seconds slower, but be able to pick up significantly heavier objects, than the opposite. Without **_TOOOT_**-ing my own horn too much, the fate of all unmentioned resolutions should be pretty clear â˜º.

On an unrelated note, I am currently recreationally studying certain particular East-Asian languages. Perhaps future blog posts will feature use of this kind of stuff.

Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays!
