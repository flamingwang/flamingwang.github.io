Though I told my readers to expect another post on dating apps, I am a flawed human being who spent the entire interim in a love-induced haze and am only right now recovering.  I am compelled to write this blog post to get closure, and will return to regular scheduled programming at a later date.   If this bothers you just realize no one is forcing you to read my blog but yet you are here anyway.

In short, I met a girl on Tinder, fell embarrassingly in love with her, then got dumped and so cried for the first time in over a decade.  However tempting it is to resent the other party, and even perhaps to become emotionally-walled and consider manipulating later partners, I try my best to try to salvage kind and [conscience-preserving][5] lessons learned.  Admittedly, I am also acutely aware that I delude myself into thinking I have more strength, willpower, and determination than I actually do, and so am also embarrassed I acted so weakly.

For anyone who is familiar with the [Naruto][1] series, the [Uchiha Clan][2] (which I once badly cosplayed) is a group of individuals who possess [Sharingan][3] eyes that grant them immense power.  These Sharingan eyes are awakened through experiencing intense feeling and emotion.  I am thoroughly convinced the ideal conditions for such an awakening are getting your heart shattered while sleep-deprived on a Tuesday night ..*cough cough*..  But instead of gaining the ability to control [kyuubi][4], I just get self-loathing, intense stubbornness, and an oddly heightened athletic ability.  Indeed, I truly could have died from my own intense stubbornness if not saved by a close friend.

Love causes one to live in denial, only to one day wake up and realize how much you compromised and degraded your own identity to conform to something you thought the other party wanted,  and then not even necessarily what they actually did.  I am ashamed and disappointed in myself but also know I'm naturally going to do the same thing again.  Perhaps just a quirk of my personality or thirst... (just kidding but maybe not actually just kidding).


So yet again, I now have a bunch of bad soda that I have no idea what to do with.  Heaven forbid I become a sick fuck and actually decide to drink it.
