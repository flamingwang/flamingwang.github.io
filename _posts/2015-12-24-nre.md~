Those of you who know me in real life know that I'm not just some goober that rants online under the disguise of "blogging." I have a life, and this life that revolves training and STUDying all the time. Sometimes the fruits of my labor pay off. Anyway, to keep things brief and mysterious, time for more training. I have lots of tests coming up that I want to ace.
