Today I took a [online quiz][1] regarding autism, and the result indicated that I was "likely suffering from an autism spectrum disorder" with a score of 35. Without a doubt, this must be because of all those [silly vaccines][2] I got as a kid...(^: ~ Jokes aside, the result is slightly unsettling, but it offers a convenient explanation for why I have deficiencies in social interaction, and perhaps also why I have greater mathematic and scientific abilities. Regarding my use of "greater," it is not just my personal feeling, but it is because I recently graduated college with a particular honor that has [three extra 'm's][3] to it (and sounds kind of disgusting too). I will eventually update the rest of my blog as well as my resume to reflect this detail.


Anyway, according to this [article][4], people with mild forms of autism (also known as Asperger Syndrome) have a selective advantage in concentration, and so can potentially accomplish greater intellectual feats than their non-autismic counterparts. Even though I cannot possibly compare myself to actual geniuses, it means there is hope for me to eventually become a productive member of society, rather than some sort of degenerate...
