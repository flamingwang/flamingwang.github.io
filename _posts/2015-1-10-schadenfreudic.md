I find it strange how no one laughs when someone succeeds, yet all of the sudden, when terrible things happen, everything becomes hilarious. Even small things in life, such as noticing that someone's day isn't going as well as yours is, are amazingly [delightful][1]. BUT OF COURSE, bad things happening to people you dislike isn't actually misfortune, it's justice. And if it just so happens that you dislike most people out there[^1], then near all misfortune is basically justice being served. Of course, I'm still a decent human bean, and in public I always refrain from pointing and laughing at *justice*. To end this post, don't take anything I say too seriously. I'm just some commoner writing in his blogâ˜º.
