Though not much has changed, since it is a new year it feels appropriate to make some resolutions. From past years I have learned that the more of these resolutions I make, the less likely any of them ever get accomplished. To avoid that this year so I will keep the list brief and simple. 



1. Write at least one blog post per month (this post counts for January)
2. Get my GPA up to at least 3.9 truncated (not rounded)
3. Get my mile time down to 5:00 or lower, and work my squat up to 2pl8 for reps (no skipping leg day)


Notice that __lose weight__ is not one of the goals, since that one is too easy [(one weird tip to lose weight fast!).][1]
