Perhaps one of the greatest advantages of being constantly in a state of bitterness and **RAGE** is that I am able to redirect it towards self-improvement, where otherwise I would just be a lazy person. In fact, I do this so often that I wonder if my internal rage and bitterness is now part of who I am as a person, such that giving it up would be losing a large part of my identity. 

I say this because the most common sink for all this **RAGE** is my frequent exercise and trying to stay healthy. Even though at first it was probably entertainment, at this point my exercise is now just a coping mechanism, as the pain and unpleasantness from lifting heavy objects is able to temporarily mask the pain and unpleasantness of my daily life. Additionally, I am never quite sure if soreness I have is actually muscular soreness, or if it is just the pain I feel from physically existing.

Whenever I feel like setting a personal record, or just lifting more than I usually do, I follow tips #2 and #3 stated in my earlier [fitness post][1]. This consolidation of pure love for the [waifu][2], general bitterness towards life, and **RAGE** from past mistreatments is enough to help me power through difficult sets. 

Anyway, recently I have started and am still continuing on with a diet to lose a bit of weight to make myself super-fit. For this, I took a picture of myself every weekend to record my progress. Today I have realized that all I actually accomplished was just a [[[tooly picture of myself every week]]] for currently 4 weeks. Just looking at them burns my soul, and makes me feel like I belong at [The Home Depot][4]. My original goal was to post this completed collection of pictures to facebook, with the intent of getting at least 10 facebook likes, but I have sufficient foresight to know that I will almost certainly get cyber-bullied for this. Accordingly, I am limiting these 'pics' to solely my personal blog, as for sure I am not popular or well-known enough for anyone to come to my blog just to cyber-bully me. 

In conclusion, after yet another long hiatus, I have returned to writing blog posts. Thanks to all who earnestly follow my blog, your support warms my heart and is sincerely appreciated.
