These past few months have been filled with various stressful events, most self-inflicted because of the occupation I have chosen and the life choices I have made. In particular, since I want to be a snooty pompous intellectual, I have chosen to be enrolled in two different graduate schools simultaneosly. These graduate schools are in addition to my full-time job, which because of special reasons, I am not allowed to quit until at least 5 years. Upon posting my life choices on [Facebook][1], I realized how anti-intellectual most of my Facebook friends are, since less than 10 people liked my status. \**HMPH!*\* I am filled with high amounts of sodium chloride, since if it was a picture of my breakfast I could have at least 20 likes! To be fair, it might be because I do not like other people's posts enough, and so they are hesistant to do the same for me. Alternatively, It could be just that I am just an unpleasant individual.

A secondary source of problems is the pain and suffering other people have inflicted on me. From this it is easy to become trapped in a state of depression, which I occassionally feel like doing. However, I am already in my twenties, and my youth and vigor is gradually draining out of me. I feel I should not expend too much effort in actions that do not improve my situation, and should instead just let things go.

Unrelated, I sometimes wonder if I would be happier had I pursued my passions, particularly passions such as "gourmet cooking" or causing other people misfortune. At the moment, pursuing these actions is just uncompensated labor, and I do **NOT** like doing things I am good at for free... (^: . Alas, I have accepted that some of my most exceptional skills, such as cutting pineapples or peeling grapefruits are not as highly valued as my engineering skills, which are nowhere near as exceptional. Specifically, I am in top 0.1% of pineapple cutters and the top 0.01% of grapefruit peelers, yet society prefers for me to work as an engineer... and blatantly shows this preference with large pay disparities!!! They do not realize that whatever contributions I make as an engineer come at the opportunity cost of fewer finely prepared fruits.... that or no one particularly cares.

Finally, since I currently live far far away from where I used to live, and do nothing but work, sleep, eat, and preventative maintenance, I do not have anyone besides coworkers and immediate family to talk to. I also dislike going outside to meet people, since I have bad social skills and possibly latent agoraphobia. If anyone who reads this would like to be my virtual pen pal, please contact me someway/somehow (at your own risk) and we can exchange correspondence but mutually agree to most likely never meet up in person.
