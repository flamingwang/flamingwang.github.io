I am an electrical engineering [college][1] student with the dream of one day working as an electrical engineer of some sort. Though I am neither bright nor talented, what I lack in brainpower I make up with sheer effort and hard work. Other than school, I enjoy watching videos on [Youtube][2], playing with my two pet dogs, and learning languages (both programming and foreign). If you are interested in the life of a commoner, feel free to stick around and read a couple posts. If you are a company recruiter, consider taking a look at this [resume][3] I try to solicit employers with. 

Finally, if you are incredibly wealthy, please consider buying one of the gifts on my Amazon [wishlist][4] for me â˜º.
