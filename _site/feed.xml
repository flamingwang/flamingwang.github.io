        <title>Purity</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A peculiar quirk I picked up this year is a strange, almost obsessive fascination with the pursuit of purity. I say &lt;strong&gt;pursuit&lt;/strong&gt; intentionally, since &lt;strong&gt;actual&lt;/strong&gt; purity is an impossibly difficult and meaningless endeavor. For example, all molecules, unless composed of only a single element, can be thought of as atomically impure. Moreover, the existence of isotopes means that even groups of the same element can also be impure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This being said, the type of purity I enjoy is on a more macroscopic level. It includes things such as &lt;strong&gt;pure food&lt;/strong&gt; (food that is not made from too many ingredients), &lt;strong&gt;pure websites&lt;/strong&gt; (websites, such as this blog, which do not utilize annoying uses of Clickbait), and &lt;strong&gt;pure love&lt;/strong&gt; (love that is not tainted with ulterior motive). Other examples of good pure things include pure gold, pure air, &lt;del&gt;pure blood&lt;/del&gt;, and pure math. Obviously, not everything pure is good (consider pure evil…), and certain impure things, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doping_(semiconductor)&quot;&gt;doped semiconductor&lt;/a&gt;, have made the world a better place. However, in general, it is easier to turn pure things impure than the other way around. Consider that making water impure is just tossing some dirt into it, but making it pure again is all sorts of fancy filtration methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My silly preoccupations with purity lead me into saying riduculous statements such as “This salad is tainted with too much dressing, I prefer something purer!” or “This person’s love is too impure, I don’t like it!”  It also leads to certain misunderstandings, such as when easily-triggered people think I am referring to more harmful, politically-incorrect, and controversial kinds of purity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am sure whatever quirks I have are relatively tame compared to other people, and so have a long ways to go before earning the right to label myself as “quirky.” Also, more likely than not, my interests in purity will fade in a couple weeks or months; I just thought it would be an amusing blog topic to write about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8 more posts to go…&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Finishing up 2016</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;After an almost year-long hiatus, I have returned to blogging, primarily to wrap up the &lt;a href=&quot;../resolutions2016&quot;&gt;list of resolutions&lt;/a&gt; I made at the start of the year. Most importantly, &lt;strong&gt;Resolution #1: Write at least one blog post per month&lt;/strong&gt; remains unfulfilled. This means I have rougly 6 days to write 10 blog posts, or face the shame of becoming a loser that was unable to complete his New Years resolutions. The exception to this is the sub 5:00 resolution, since, as year 2016 progressed, I realized that I would rather run a couple seconds slower, and to pick up significantly heavier objects, than the opposite. Without &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;TOOOT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;-ing my own horn too much, the fate of all unmentioned resolutions should be pretty clear ☺.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On an unrelated note, I am currently recreationally studying certain particular East-Asian languages. Perhaps future blog posts will feature use of this kind of stuff. 日本語の字が書ける…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Quest for Freedom</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;One of my goals in life is to obtain lots of money, such that I become part of the 1%. This is not because I want to be a rich oppressive shitlord, but because money is true freedom, and I want to be free person. For example, the average wage worker does not truly have freedom of speech, since if he speaks his mind he can get fired. If he is fired and cannot find another source of income, he may soon not have enough money to afford basic food and shelter. Therefore, his lack of money restrains him from voicing any of his controversial opinions. Compare this to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump&quot;&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt;, who is able to voice all sorts of opinions without any fear of not having a place to live or food to eat. The goal therefore is to become like Donald Trump, not in political belief, but in wealth and power. When this happens I can finally release all my opinions, which, like vegetables, are unpopular but good for people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AFAIK, there are only two ways to achieve this goal: be lucky or work hard. Since I can only control the latter way, I should work harder than everyone around me. This is easy since currently the only people around me are college students ☺.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Explaining the previous sentence would be opening a giant can of offense, something I do not yet have the power to do without reprecussion.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>2016</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Though not much has changed, since it is a new year it feels appropriate to make some resolutions. From past years I have learned that the more of these resolutions I make, the less likely any of them ever get accomplished. To avoid that this year so I will keep the list brief and simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Write at least one blog post per month (this post counts for January)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get my GPA up to at least 3.9 truncated (not rounded)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get my mile time down to 5:00 or lower, and work my squat up to 2pl8 for reps (no skipping leg day)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice that &lt;strong&gt;lose weight&lt;/strong&gt; is not one of the goals, since that one is too easy &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6ula2m5fw&quot;&gt;(one weird tip to lose weight fast!).&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Opinionated: Part II</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There seems to be a direct relation between years I’ve been alive and number of things that annoy me. So much so that it’s time for another list of things I dislike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Quarter-squats, quarter-pull-ups, quarter-push-ups, quarter anything in general&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Crying children on airplanes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bottled water which costs more than $1.25&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://translate.google.com/?ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;client=tw-ob#auto/es/cloud&quot;&gt;Spanish clouds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;People who post their political opinions on Facebook&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Individuals who have a net output to society which is negative&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wetzels Pretzels&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stupid people who think my waifu is shit when actually it is their waifu that is shit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Those of you who know me in real life know that I’m not just some goober that rants online under the disguise of “blogging.” I have a life, and this life that revolves training and STUDying all the time. Sometimes the fruits of my labor pay off. Anyway, to keep things brief and mysterious, time for more training. I have lots of tests coming up that I want to ace.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Migration</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;After typing a bunch of stuff I do not understand into a terminal (i.e. a typical day with Linux), my blog has been migrated from &lt;a href=&quot;https://divshot.com/&quot;&gt;Divshot&lt;/a&gt; over to &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com/&quot;&gt;Github Pages&lt;/a&gt;. This is because Divshot is becoming a part of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.firebase.com/&quot;&gt;Firebase&lt;/a&gt;, and I do not understand data enough to properly utilize the Firebase development platform. Moreover, I have to pay them $5 a month if I want to have a custom domain, but Github Pages lets me do this for free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What all this means is you can read my blog at &lt;a href=&quot;https://flamingwang.github.io&quot;&gt;flamingwang.github.io&lt;/a&gt;, or you can read it at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.seanwang.org&quot;&gt;seanwang.org&lt;/a&gt;, they are aliases of each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I personally prefer &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.seanwang.org&quot;&gt;seanwang.org&lt;/a&gt;, since this makes me seem like a legit organization.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Happy Birthday 39</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Today is the 8th birthday of my favorite songstress who, though I never mentioned before, was another inspiration for the decoration of my blog. My first memory of her goes all the way back to high school when, after getting bored of playing too much &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DJMax&quot;&gt;DJMax&lt;/a&gt;, I decided to play &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatsune_Miku:_Project_DIVA&quot;&gt;Project Diva&lt;/a&gt; (all of them, and all on extreme). At that time I only put up with her because I liked rhythm games, but over time she grew on me until I listened to her just to pass time. As even more time passed, she became my inspiration for doing my best every day, or “waifu” for those who are familiar with the term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for all the gaming and fun memories, but also for motivation to keep going on the stressful days when I just wanted to give up. The future is uncertain but I hope to remain a loyal fan for all of my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a side note, I have uploaded a newer version of my &lt;a href=&quot;/resources/resume.pdf&quot;&gt;resume&lt;/a&gt;, take a look at it and reach out to me if you see anything you like.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Soup Scammer</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been learning lots from my summer internship, and have discovered an extremely efficient but incredibly EVIL way of getting a nutritious filling meal for low cost. I have named this strategy &lt;strong&gt;Soup Scamming&lt;/strong&gt; and it involves going to the soup counter, draining out the watery portions of a soup, and then only scooping the solid portions. This means you squeeze a full meal out of the soup of the day, but the poor schmuck who wants soup after you is only left with watery stuff. Below is a list of soups and their resulting outcomes after scamming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IMPORTANT NOTE: Out of compassion for your fellow human beans you should &lt;abbr title=&quot;But you will anyway&quot;&gt;NEVER&lt;/abbr&gt; do this…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Soup&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Scammer&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Schmuck&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Chicken Noodle    &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Chicken Pasta&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Chicken Water&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Minestrone&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Pasta in Red Sauce   &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Tomato Water&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Pozole&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Maize and Meat&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Spicy Water&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Chili&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Extra Meaty Chili&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Watery Chili&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Clam Chowder&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Clam and Potatoes&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Clam-Flavored Cream&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

        <title>Opinionated</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I get annoyed by seemingly harmless things. So, since it has been a while since I have written any blog posts, I have decided to make a list of some things I dislike. Perhaps some of you readers have these same pet peeves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;People who eat breakfast foods (cereal) for any other meal besides breakfast&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;People who don’t pick up after their dog&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;99% of all children&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;People who say “just be yourself” unironically&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;People who cannot integrate cos&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;(x) in their head&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Having to pay taxes to avoid getting arrested and put in jail&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Narcissists, histrionics, tourists, and shills&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
