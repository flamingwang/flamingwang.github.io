        <title>2016</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Though not much has changed, since it is a new year it feels appropriate to make some resolutions. From past years I have learned that the more of these resolutions I make, the less likely any of them ever get accomplished. To avoid that this year so I will keep the list brief and simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Write at least one blog post per month (this post counts for January)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get my GPA up to at least 3.9 truncated (not rounded)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get my mile time down to 5:00 or lower, and work my squat up to 2pl8 for reps (no skipping leg day)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice that &lt;strong&gt;lose weight&lt;/strong&gt; is not one of the goals, since that one is too easy &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6ula2m5fw&quot;&gt;(just amputate something).&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Opinionated: Part II</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There seems to be a direct relation between years I’ve been alive and number of things that annoy me. So much so that it’s time for another list of things I dislike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Quarter-squats, quarter-pull-ups, quarter-push-ups, quarter anything in general&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Crying children on airplanes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bottled water which costs more than $1.25&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://translate.google.com/?ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;client=tw-ob#auto/es/cloud&quot;&gt;Spanish clouds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;People who post their political opinions on Facebook&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Individuals who have a net output to society which is negative&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wetzels Pretzels&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stupid people who think my waifu is shit when actually it is their waifu that is shit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Those of you who know me in real life know that I’m not just some goober that rants online under the disguise of “blogging.” I have a life, and this life that revolves training and STUDying all the time. Sometimes the fruits of my labor pay off. Anyway, to keep things brief and mysterious, time for more training. I have lots of tests coming up that I want to ace.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Migration</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;After typing a bunch of stuff I do not understand into a terminal (i.e. a typical day with Linux), my blog has been migrated from &lt;a href=&quot;https://divshot.com/&quot;&gt;Divshot&lt;/a&gt; over to &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com/&quot;&gt;Github Pages&lt;/a&gt;. This is because Divshot is becoming a part of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.firebase.com/&quot;&gt;Firebase&lt;/a&gt;, and I do not understand data enough to properly utilize the Firebase development platform. Moreover, I have to pay them $5 a month if I want to have a custom domain, but Github Pages lets me do this for free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What all this means is you can read my blog at &lt;a href=&quot;https://flamingwang.github.io&quot;&gt;flamingwang.github.io&lt;/a&gt;, or you can read it at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.seanwang.org&quot;&gt;seanwang.org&lt;/a&gt;, they are aliases of each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I personally prefer &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.seanwang.org&quot;&gt;seanwang.org&lt;/a&gt;, since this makes me seem like a legit organization.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Happy Birthday 39</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Today is the 8th birthday of my favorite songstress who, though I never mentioned before, was another inspiration for the decoration of my blog. My first memory of her goes all the way back to high school when, after getting bored of playing too much &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DJMax&quot;&gt;DJMax&lt;/a&gt;, I decided to play &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatsune_Miku:_Project_DIVA&quot;&gt;Project Diva&lt;/a&gt; (all of them, and all on extreme). At that time I only put up with her because I liked rhythm games, but over time she grew on me until I listened to her just to pass time. As even more time passed, she became my inspiration for doing my best every day, or “waifu” for those who are familiar with the term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for all the gaming and fun memories, but also for motivation to keep going on the stressful days when I just wanted to give up. The future is uncertain but I hope to remain a loyal fan for all of my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a side note, I have uploaded a newer version of my &lt;a href=&quot;/resources/resume.pdf&quot;&gt;resume&lt;/a&gt;, take a look at it and reach out to me if you see anything you like.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Soup Scammer</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been learning lots from my summer internship, and have discovered an extremely efficient but incredibly EVIL way of getting a nutritious filling meal for low cost. I have named this strategy &lt;strong&gt;Soup Scamming&lt;/strong&gt; and it involves going to the soup counter, draining out the watery portions of a soup, and then only scooping the solid portions. This means you squeeze a full meal out of the soup of the day, but the poor schmuck who wants soup after you is only left with watery stuff. Below is a list of soups and their resulting outcomes after scamming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IMPORTANT NOTE: Out of compassion for your fellow human beans you should &lt;abbr title=&quot;But you will anyway&quot;&gt;NEVER&lt;/abbr&gt; do this…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Soup&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Scammer&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Schmuck&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Chicken Noodle    &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Chicken Pasta&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Chicken Water&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Minestrone&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Pasta in Red Sauce   &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Tomato Water&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Pozole&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Maize and Meat&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Spicy Water&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Chili&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Extra Meaty Chili&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Watery Chili&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Clam Chowder&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Clam and Potatoes&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Clam-Flavored Cream&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

        <title>Opinionated</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I get annoyed by seemingly harmless things. So, since it has been a while since I have written any blog posts, I have decided to make a list of some things I dislike. Perhaps some of you readers have these same pet peeves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;People who eat breakfast foods (i.e. cereal) for any other meal besides breakfast&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;People who don’t pick up after their dog&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;99% of all children&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;People who say “just be yourself” unironically&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;People who cannot integrate cos&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;(x) in their head&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Having to pay taxes to avoid getting arrested and put in jail&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Narcissists, histrionics, tourists, and shills&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

        <title>Blogging is HARD Work</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;After only a couple posts last winter, I discovered that I am too incompetent to blog properly. Perhaps one day I’ll learn to write correctly, but for now, I am focusing on other things such as a summer job and an unending journey of self-discovery. Added to that, I’m sure no one was genuinely interested in what I had to say anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the bright side, my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.directv.com&quot;&gt;current summer job&lt;/a&gt; is the best I’ve ever had. It provides me with enough money to buy many things I’ve always wanted but never could afford. This means I can easily buy all of the things that are on my &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.com/w/2B7EE881J848W&quot;&gt;wishlist&lt;/a&gt;, I just still have that poor-guy mentality and am not used to spending large amounts of money… yet. Also, even though my current lifestyle is by no means considered wealthy (first-world standards), the end dream of video games and all-you-can-eat buffets every weekend is slowly becoming more realizable.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Schadenfreudic</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I find it strange how no one laughs when someone succeeds, yet all of the sudden, when terrible things happen, everything becomes hilarious. Even small things in life, such as noticing that someone’s day isn’t going as well as yours is, are amazingly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRFa6e63-iY&quot;&gt;delightful&lt;/a&gt;. BUT OF COURSE, bad things happening to people you dislike isn’t actually misfortune, it’s justice. And if it just so happens that you dislike most people out there&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, then near all misfortune is basically justice being served. Of course, I’m still a decent human bean, and in public I always refrain from pointing and laughing at &lt;em&gt;justice&lt;/em&gt;. To end this post, don’t take anything I say too seriously. I’m just some commoner writing in his blog☺.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;One pretty cool thing about going to a diverse &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.admissions.ucla.edu/campusprofile.htm&quot;&gt;college&lt;/a&gt; is instead of only learning to hate one or two groups of people, you grow to hate everyone. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>I am Computer Scientist?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Every time I have to take a computer class, I feel it must be blatantly obvious to all the people around me that I am not actually a computer science major (well maybe not THAT obvious… I still remain Asian). I imagine for other people it’s probably a huge ego boost to sit next to the guy that needs to look at his fingers all the time when he’s typing. With that said, this quarter I am enrolled in a class called “Software Construction Laboratory,” and so far the goal has been learning how to read ambiguous specifications. It is either that, or Telepathy 101 was supposed to be a pre-requisite class but the school registrar forgot and let me enroll anyway. Only one week into school but already I feel myself becoming one with the ambiguity. Reminds me of drinking &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr_Pepper&quot;&gt;Dr Pepper&lt;/a&gt; and solving trig problems involving &lt;a href=&quot;http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ASSTheorem.html&quot;&gt;one angle and two sides&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
