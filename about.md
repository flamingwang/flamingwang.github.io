I am an electrical engineering cubicle minion of some sort. Though I am neither bright nor talented, what I lack in brainpower I make up with sheer effort and hard work. Other than work, I enjoy watching videos on [Youtube][2], learning languages (both programming and foreign), and writing to cope with emotional pain. If you are interested in the life of a commoner, feel free to stick around and read a couple posts. 

Finally, if you are incredibly wealthy, please consider buying a gift on my Amazon [wishlist][3] for me â˜º.
